## pytask-dev â€“ the organization for the pytask ecosystem

At pytask-dev, we develop the ecosystem for
[pytask](https://pytask-dev.readthedocs.io/en/stable), a workflow management system for
reproducible data analyses.

Our main projects are:

- [pytask](https://github.com/pytask-dev/pytask): The workflow management system.
- [pytask-parallel](https://github.com/pytask-dev/pytask-parallel): A plugin to
  parallelize task execution locally or remotely with the cloud provider of your choice.
- [cookiecutter-pytask-project](https://github.com/pytask-dev/cookiecutter-pytask-project):
  A template for a research project with pytask.

There are many more plugins for pytask.

- [pytask-latex](https://github.com/pytask-dev/pytask-latex): Compile LaTeX documents.
- [pytask-r](https://github.com/pytask-dev/pytask-r): Integrate R scripts in your
  workflows.
- [pytask-julia](https://github.com/pytask-dev/pytask-julia): Integrate Julia scripts in
  your workflows.
- [pytask-stata](https://github.com/pytask-dev/pytask-stata): Integrate Stata's do files
  in your workflows.

Any contribution to the ecosystem is welcome! Raise an issue, file a feature request,
open a discussion, solve an issue or write a plugin.
